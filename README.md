## Experience

 ## Projects:  
 
- **[CloudSync](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/Cloudsync)** — A distributed storage cloud where users lend disk space to form a decentralized file system with in-memory metadata, direct HTTP uploads, and gRPC pipelined replication (the Master never touches file data).
 
- **[ShellSync](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/shellsync)** — A real-time collaborative terminal over HTTP (not SSH) where others can watch you type commands (and typos) live.

- **[RuralSync (Monolith)](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/RuralSync-API)** — A village marketplace running as one big happy server doing everything at once.

- **[RuralSync (Microservices)](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/Agent-RuralSync)** — The same marketplace split into services, queues, and containers to prove it can scale and look cool in diagrams.  
  ↳ [Service Provider](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/service-provider-ruralsync)

- **[Context Aware Firewall](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/SIH-Context-Aware-Firewall)** — A remote “NOPE” switch for domains, IPs, ports, and suspicious processes across devices.

- **[Communet](https://github.com/Commu-net/)** — A full stack app that does “professional detective work” on LinkedIn for emails.

- **[Boom](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/meet_backend)** — A WebRTC meet clone built from curiosity, caffeine, and questionable sleep cycles.  
  ↳ [Frontend](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/parichay_frontend)

- **[LinkShort](https://linkshort-bay.vercel.app/)** — Gives long URLs a short, dramatic life with instant redirects.

- **[EdTech LMS](https://lms-frontend-opal.vercel.app/)** — A place where courses live peacefully… until exams show up.

- **[BRAND](https://rituraj12797.github.io/FRONTEND/)** — A blogging platform for thoughts that refuse to stay inside your head.

- **[Pokedex](https://hilarious-caramel-5bd052.netlify.app/)** — Because knowing only Pikachu is scientifically unacceptable.
